                    <p><strong>Look for:</strong> Mercantilism and economic promises - wealth through trade. But who got the wealth?</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 10px;"><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Economic independence was a stepping stone to political independence. Understanding who benefited economically helps explain who had power.</p>

                    <p><strong>Look for:</strong> Who benefited vs. who suffered from the Triangle Trade. Notice the contradiction: building wealth on slavery while claiming "all men are created equal."</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 10px;"><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Enslaved people would later use American ideals (especially the Declaration) to fight against slavery. They believed in the ideals even when excluded from them.</p>

                <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
                <p><strong>The Big Idea:</strong> The Triangle Trade was a system of trade between Europe, Africa, and the Americas that generated enormous wealth for European merchants and American plantation owners, but caused immense suffering and death for millions of enslaved Africans. This economic system was fundamental to the colonial economy.</p>

                <h3>Major Themes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Three-Way Trade System:</strong> Europe, Africa, and the Americas were connected by trade routes</li>
                    <li><strong>Economic Exploitation:</strong> The system enriched some while devastating others</li>
                    <li><strong>The Middle Passage:</strong> The horrific journey of enslaved Africans across the Atlantic</li>
                    <li><strong>Mercantilism:</strong> Economic system where colonies existed to benefit the mother country</li>
                    <li><strong>Human Cost:</strong> Millions of people were kidnapped, enslaved, and died during this trade</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Three Parts of the Triangle Trade</h2>

                <h3>Leg 1: Europe to Africa</h3>
                <p><strong>What was traded:</strong> Manufactured goods from Europe</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Guns, gunpowder, weapons</li>
                    <li>Cloth and textiles</li>
                    <li>Rum and alcohol</li>
                    <li>Tools and metal goods</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> European merchants traded these goods with African traders in exchange for enslaved people</p>

                <h3>Leg 2: Africa to the Americas (The Middle Passage)</h3>
                <p><strong>What was traded:</strong> Enslaved Africans</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Millions of Africans were kidnapped or captured in wars</li>
                    <li>Forced onto ships in horrific conditions</li>
                    <li>Chained together in cargo holds with little space, food, or water</li>
                    <li>Many died from disease, starvation, or suicide during the journey</li>
                    <li>Those who survived were sold as property in the Americas</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>The Human Cost:</strong> This was the most brutal leg of the journey. Approximately 12-15 million Africans were forced into slavery, and about 2 million died during the Middle Passage.</p>

                <h2>The Middle Passage: Understanding the Horror</h2>
                <p><strong>Conditions on Slave Ships:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Enslaved people were chained and packed tightly in cargo holds</li>
                    <li>No room to stand or move; lying in rows inches apart</li>
                    <li>Little food or water; terrible sanitation</li>
                    <li>Disease spread rapidly (dysentery, smallpox)</li>
                    <li>Journey lasted 6-8 weeks or longer</li>
                    <li>Many died and were thrown overboard</li>
                    <li>Some jumped overboard to escape the horror</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Arrival in the Americas:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Survivors were sold at auctions like property</li>
                    <li>Families were separated and sold to different owners</li>
                    <li>Forced to work on plantations with no freedom or rights</li>
                    <li>Enslavement was for life and passed to children</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 style="margin-top: 30px;">Connection to Mercantilism</h2>
                <p>The Triangle Trade was part of the larger economic system of <strong>mercantilism</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Colonies existed to make the mother country (Britain) wealthy</li>
                    <li>Colonies provided cheap raw materials</li>
                    <li>Colonies bought expensive manufactured goods from the mother country</li>
                    <li>This system benefited Britain but restricted colonial economic freedom</li>
                    <li>Later, colonists would resent these economic restrictions (contributing to the Revolution)</li>

                        <h4 style="color: #3b82f6; margin-bottom: 10px;">For Question 1 (Revolutionary Ideals):</h4>
                        <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                            <li><strong>Mercantilism:</strong> Promised prosperity through trade - but raised questions about economic freedom</li>
                            <li><strong>Economic independence:</strong> Was a stepping stone to political independence</li>
                            <li><strong>Colonial economies:</strong> Showed early tensions between wealth creation and human rights</li>

                        <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                            <li><strong>Who benefited:</strong> European merchants, colonial plantation owners - became wealthy from enslaved labor</li>
                            <li><strong>Who suffered:</strong> Enslaved Africans - kidnapped from homes, endured Middle Passage, forced into brutal labor</li>
                            <li><strong>The contradiction:</strong> Building wealth on slavery while claiming "all men are created equal"</li>
                            <li><strong>Key point:</strong> Enslaved people would use American ideals (especially the Declaration) to fight for freedom - they believed in those ideals even when excluded from them</li>
                            <li><strong>African communities:</strong> Lost millions of people; societies disrupted by the trade</li>
