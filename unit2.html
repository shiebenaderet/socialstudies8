            <h2>Essential Question</h2>
            <p class="big-question">How did the Triangle Trade create wealth for some while causing suffering for others?</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
            <p><strong>The Big Idea:</strong> The Triangle Trade was a system of trade between Europe, Africa, and the Americas that generated enormous wealth for European merchants and American plantation owners, but caused immense suffering and death for millions of enslaved Africans. This economic system was fundamental to the colonial economy.</p>

            <h3>Major Themes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Three-Way Trade System:</strong> Europe, Africa, and the Americas were connected by trade routes</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Exploitation:</strong> The system enriched some while devastating others</li>
                <li><strong>The Middle Passage:</strong> The horrific journey of enslaved Africans across the Atlantic</li>
                <li><strong>Mercantilism:</strong> Economic system where colonies existed to benefit the mother country</li>
                <li><strong>Human Cost:</strong> Millions of people were kidnapped, enslaved, and died during this trade</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Three Parts of the Triangle Trade</h2>

            <h3>Leg 1: Europe to Africa</h3>
            <p><strong>What was traded:</strong> Manufactured goods from Europe</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Guns, gunpowder, weapons</li>
                <li>Cloth and textiles</li>
                <li>Rum and alcohol</li>
                <li>Tools and metal goods</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> European merchants traded these goods with African traders in exchange for enslaved people</p>

            <h3>Leg 2: Africa to the Americas (The Middle Passage)</h3>
            <p><strong>What was traded:</strong> Enslaved Africans</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Millions of Africans were kidnapped or captured in wars</li>
                <li>Forced onto ships in horrific conditions</li>
                <li>Chained together in cargo holds with little space, food, or water</li>
                <li>Many died from disease, starvation, or suicide during the journey</li>
                <li>Those who survived were sold as property in the Americas</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The Human Cost:</strong> This was the most brutal leg of the journey. Approximately 12-15 million Africans were forced into slavery, and about 2 million died during the Middle Passage.</p>

            <h3>Leg 3: Americas to Europe</h3>
            <p><strong>What was traded:</strong> Raw materials and cash crops</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sugar (Caribbean)</li>
                <li>Tobacco (Virginia, Maryland)</li>
                <li>Cotton (later, in Southern states)</li>
                <li>Rice and indigo (South Carolina)</li>
                <li>Molasses and rum</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> These products were grown on plantations using enslaved labor and shipped to Europe for profit</p>

            <h2>Connection to Mercantilism</h2>
            <p>The Triangle Trade was part of the larger economic system of <strong>mercantilism</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Colonies existed to make the mother country (Britain) wealthy</li>
                <li>Colonies provided cheap raw materials</li>
                <li>Colonies bought expensive manufactured goods from the mother country</li>
                <li>This system benefited Britain but restricted colonial economic freedom</li>
                <li>Later, colonists would resent these economic restrictions (contributing to the Revolution)</li>
