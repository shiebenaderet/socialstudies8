            <h2>Essential Question</h2>
            <p class="big-question">How did geography and economic systems create different societies in colonial America?</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
            <p><strong>The Big Idea:</strong> The 13 colonies developed very different societies based on their geography, climate, and natural resources. These differences shaped their economies, social structures, and eventually their perspectives on independence.</p>

            <h3>Major Themes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Regional Differences:</strong> New England, Middle, and Southern colonies had distinct characteristics</li>
                <li><strong>Geography Shapes Economy:</strong> Climate and natural resources determined what colonists could produce and trade</li>
                <li><strong>Indigenous Impact:</strong> European colonization displaced and devastated Indigenous peoples</li>
                <li><strong>Labor Systems:</strong> Different regions used different forms of labor (indentured servants, enslaved people, small farmers)</li>
                <li><strong>Early Self-Government:</strong> Colonies began developing their own forms of representative government</li>
            </ul>
