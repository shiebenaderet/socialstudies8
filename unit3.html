                <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
                <p><strong>The Big Idea:</strong> The American Revolution meant different things to different people. While some saw it as a fight for freedom and independence, others saw it as a threat to their way of life, economic interests, or safety. Understanding these diverse perspectives helps us see that history is complex and that the same event can have very different meanings depending on who you are.</p>

                <h3>Major Themes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Multiple Perspectives:</strong> Patriots, Loyalists, enslaved people, Indigenous nations, women, and soldiers all had different reasons for supporting or opposing the Revolution</li>
                    <li><strong>The Paradox of Freedom:</strong> America fought for liberty while denying freedom to enslaved people</li>
                    <li><strong>Unheard Voices:</strong> Many groups contributed to the Revolution but their stories are often left out of traditional histories</li>
                    <li><strong>Causes of the Revolution:</strong> Taxation without representation, British control, economic restrictions</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
